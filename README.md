# Image-Seam
## Description
The Image-Seam project focuses on resizing images dynamically by utilizing seam carving techniques. Seam carving involves the removal of less significant pixels along the least significant path in a specified direction, thereby adjusting the image's dimensions while preserving its essential features.

This project is inspired by concepts from the Princeton Algorithms, Part II course, where advanced techniques for image processing and optimization are explored.

For more details and a demonstration, refer to the <a href="https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/seam/specification.php">Specification</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcIJXTlugc">YouTube</a> example.

This project demonstrates advanced image manipulation techniques, providing a flexible approach to resizing images while maintaining their visual integrity and quality.

## Getting started.
  <p>
  To use this class, you must have <code>Picture</code> in your Java classpath.
  Here are three possible ways to do this:
  </p><ul>
  <li> If you ran our autoinstaller, use the commands
  <code>javac-introcs</code> and <code>java-introcs</code> (or <code>javac-algs4</code>
  and <code>java-algs4</code>) when compiling and executing. These commands
  add <code>stdlib.jar</code> (or <code>algs4.jar</code>) to the Java classpath, which
  provides access to <code>Picture</code>.

  </li><li> Download <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/code/stdlib.jar">stdlib.jar</a>
  (or <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar">algs4.jar</a>)
  and add it to the Java classpath.

  </li><li> Download <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdPicture.java">StdPicture.java</a>
  and
  <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/Picture.java">Picture.java</a>
  and put them in the working directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    Change `PATH_TO_FILE` in main to your image path, after running, there should appear a window with a processed image (this may take some time).
  </li>
  </ul>
